# DBMS Webapp Project

Creating a simple streaming application, or as Pranav would call it, **"Gareebo ka Netflix"**

* [x] Home page
* [x] Didnt mean to do this, but ended up doing a header anyways. Its beautiful.
* [x] sign in page front end
* [x] sign up page front end
* [x] sign up back end in php
* [x] sign in back end in php (has to be in the same page i guess)
>> Tells if the username/pwd is correct or not in the same page. Thats cool.

* [x] Movies page
* [x] Series page

* [x] Admin block lmao
    * [ ] Add new admin
    * [ ] Add new movies
    * [ ] Add new series

## Future goals

* [ ] will implement them using Angular later
* [ ] probably learn django, shift from php to django
* [ ] correct a small bug (user can directly get in if he types in the correct url)
